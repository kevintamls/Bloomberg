Dear Sir/Madam,
This is a GitHub repository showcasing past works. The Java folder contains code that implements Data Structures and Algorithms, whilst Python contains Python code that solves a recursive teller problem and a collaborative team game written in Python3.

Warm regards,
Tam Kevin Lok Sun
